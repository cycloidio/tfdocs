			Category:         "ACM Resources",
			ShortDescription: `Requests and manages a certificate from Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM).`,
			Description: `

The ACM certificate resource allows requesting and management of certificates
from the Amazon Certificate Manager.

It deals with requesting certificates and managing their attributes and life-cycle.
This resource does not deal with validation of a certificate but can provide inputs
for other resources implementing the validation. It does not wait for a certificate to be issued.
Use a [` + "`" + `aws_acm_certificate_validation` + "`" + `](acm_certificate_validation.html) resource for this.

Most commonly, this resource is used to together with [` + "`" + `aws_route53_record` + "`" + `](route53_record.html) and
[` + "`" + `aws_acm_certificate_validation` + "`" + `](acm_certificate_validation.html) to request a DNS validated certificate,
deploy the required validation records and wait for validation to complete.

Domain validation through E-Mail is also supported but should be avoided as it requires a manual step outside
of Terraform.

It's recommended to specify ` + "`" + `create_before_destroy = true` + "`" + ` in a [lifecycle][1] block to replace a certificate
which is currently in use (eg, by [` + "`" + `aws_lb_listener` + "`" + `](lb_listener.html)).

The created AMI will refer to implicitly-created snapshots of the instance's
EBS volumes and mimick its assigned block device configuration at the time
the resource is created.

This resource is best applied to an instance that is stopped when this instance
is created, so that the contents of the created image are predictable. When
applied to an instance that is running, *the instance will be stopped before taking
the snapshots and then started back up again*, resulting in a period of
downtime.

Note that the source instance is inspected only at the initial creation of this
resource. Ongoing updates to the referenced instance will not be propagated into
the generated AMI. Users may taint or otherwise recreate the resource in order
to produce a fresh snapshot.

			ShortDescription: `Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway.`,
			Description: `

Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway. Additional information about this functionality
can be found in the [API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html).

This resource just establishes ownership of and the TLS settings for
a particular domain name. An API can be attached to a particular path
under the registered domain name using
[the ` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_base_path_mapping.html).

API Gateway domains can be defined as either 'edge-optimized' or 'regional'.  In an edge-optimized configuration,
API Gateway internally creates and manages a CloudFront distribution to route requests on the given hostname. In
addition to this resource it's necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the given domain name which is an alias
(either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the Cloudfront domain name exported in the ` + "`" + `cloudfront_domain_name` + "`" + `
attribute.

In a regional configuration, API Gateway does not create a CloudFront distribution to route requests to the API, though
a distribution can be created if needed. In either case, it is necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the
given domain name which is an alias (either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the regional domain name exported in
the ` + "`" + `regional_domain_name` + "`" + ` attribute.

~> **Note:** API Gateway requires the use of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates instead of Identity and Access Management (IAM) certificates in regions that support ACM. Regions that support ACM can be found in the [Regions and Endpoints Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#acm_region). To import an existing private key and certificate into ACM or request an ACM certificate, see the [` + "`" + `aws_acm_certificate` + "`" + ` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/acm_certificate.html).

~> **Note:** All arguments including the private key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.

environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created
databases.

Changes to a DB instance can occur when you manually change a parameter, such as

of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because a
modification has not yet taken place. You can use the ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` flag
to instruct the service to apply the change immediately (see documentation
below).

When upgrading the major version of an engine, ` + "`" + `allow_major_version_upgrade` + "`" + `
must be set to ` + "`" + `true` + "`" + `.

~> **Note:** using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a brief downtime as the
server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][2] for more information.

ACL that cannot be destroyed, and is created with a known set of default rules.

When Terraform first adopts the Default Network ACL, it **immediately removes all
rules in the ACL**. It then proceeds to create any rules specified in the
configuration. This step is required so that only the rules specified in the
configuration are created.

This resource treats its inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined
inline are created, and any additions/removals external to this resource will
result in diffs being shown. For these reasons, this resource is incompatible with the
` + "`" + `aws_network_acl_rule` + "`" + ` resource.

In order to "delete" the association between a Subnet and a non-default Network ACL, the association is destroyed by replacing it with an association between the Subnet and the Default ACL instead. When managing the Default Network ACL, you cannot "remove" Subnets. Instead, they must be reassigned to another Network ACL, or the Subnet itself must be destroyed. Because of these requirements, removing the ` + "`" + `subnet_ids` + "`" + ` attribute from the configuration of a ` + "`" + `aws_default_network_acl` + "`" + ` resource may result in a reoccurring plan, until the Subnets are reassigned to another Network ACL or are destroyed. Because Subnets are by default associated with the Default Network ACL, any non-explicit association will show up as a plan to remove the Subnet. For example: if you have a custom ` + "`" + `aws_network_acl` + "`" + ` with two subnets attached, and you remove the ` + "`" + `aws_network_acl` + "`" + ` resource, after successfully destroying this resource future plans will show a diff on the managed ` + "`" + `aws_default_network_acl` + "`" + `, as those two Subnets have been orphaned by the now destroyed network acl and thus adopted by the Default Network ACL. In order to avoid a reoccurring plan, they will need to be reassigned, destroyed, or added to the ` + "`" + `subnet_ids` + "`" + ` attribute of the ` + "`" + `aws_default_network_acl` + "`" + ` entry. As an alternative to the above, you can also specify the following lifecycle configuration in your ` + "`" + `aws_default_network_acl` + "`" + ` resource: ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `` + "`" + `hcl lifecycle { ignore_changes = ["subnet_ids"] } ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `` + "`" + ` ### Removing ` + "`" + `aws_default_network_acl` + "`" + ` from your configuration Each AWS VPC comes with a Default Network ACL that cannot be deleted.

Each VPC created in AWS comes with a Default Route Table that can be managed, but not

When Terraform first adopts the Default Route Table, it **immediately removes all

provides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html) and a Route Table resource with routes
defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes

a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite routes.

destroyed, and are created with a known set of default ingress/egress rules.

When Terraform first adopts the Default Security Group, it **immediately removes all
ingress and egress rules in the Security Group**. It then proceeds to create any rules specified in the
configuration. This step is required so that only the rules specified in the
configuration are created.

This resource treats its inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined
inline are created, and any additions/removals external to this resource will
result in diff shown. For these reasons, this resource is incompatible with the
` + "`" + `aws_security_group_rule` + "`" + ` resource.

For more information about Default Security Groups, see the AWS Documentation on
[Default Security Groups][aws-default-security-groups].

Changes to an MQ Broker can occur when you change a

window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the

(see documentation below).

~> **Note:** using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a
brief downtime as the broker reboots.

in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

Changes to a RDS Cluster can occur when you manually change a
parameter, such as ` + "`" + `port` + "`" + `, and are reflected in the next maintenance
window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately
(see documentation below).

~> **Note:** using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a
brief downtime as the server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][4]
for more information.

Provides an RDS Cluster Instance Resource. A Cluster Instance Resource defines
attributes that are specific to a single instance in a [RDS Cluster][3],
specifically running Amazon Aurora.

Unlike other RDS resources that support replication, with Amazon Aurora you do
not designate a primary and subsequent replicas. Instead, you simply add RDS
Instances and Aurora manages the replication. You can use the [count][5]
meta-parameter to make multiple instances and join them all to the same RDS
Cluster, or you may specify different Cluster Instance resources with various
` + "`" + `instance_class` + "`" + ` sizes.

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see [Aurora on Amazon RDS][2] in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

You can still add the [` + "`" + `prevent_destroy` + "`" + ` lifecycle behavior](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#prevent_destroy) to your Terraform resource configuration if you desire protection from accidental deletion.

			Description: `

Provides a resource to create a VPC routing table.

~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently
provides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html) and a Route Table resource with routes
defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes
in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause
a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.

~> **NOTE on ` + "`" + `gateway_id` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `nat_gateway_id` + "`" + `:** The AWS API is very forgiving with these two
attributes and the ` + "`" + `aws_route_table` + "`" + ` resource can be created with a NAT ID specified as a Gateway ID attribute.
This _will_ lead to a permanent diff between your configuration and statefile, as the API returns the correct
parameters in the returned route table. If you're experiencing constant diffs in your ` + "`" + `aws_route_table` + "`" + ` resources,
the first thing to check is whether or not you're specifying a NAT ID instead of a Gateway ID, or vice-versa.

~> **NOTE on ` + "`" + `propagating_vgws` + "`" + ` and the ` + "`" + `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation` + "`" + ` resource:**
If the ` + "`" + `propagating_vgws` + "`" + ` argument is present, it's not supported to _also_
define route propagations using ` + "`" + `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation` + "`" + `, since
this resource will delete any propagating gateways not explicitly listed in

  Provides a resource for subscribing to SNS topics. Requires that an SNS topic exist for the subscription to attach to.
This resource allows you to automatically place messages sent to SNS topics in SQS queues, send them as HTTP(S) POST requests
to a given endpoint, send SMS messages, or notify devices / applications. The most likely use case for Terraform users will
probably be SQS queues.

~> **NOTE:** If the SNS topic and SQS queue are in different AWS regions, it is important for the "aws_sns_topic_subscription" to use an AWS provider that is in the same region of the SNS topic. If the "aws_sns_topic_subscription" is using a provider with a different region than the SNS topic, terraform will fail to create the subscription.

~> **NOTE:** Setup of cross-account subscriptions from SNS topics to SQS queues requires Terraform to have access to BOTH accounts.

~> **NOTE:** If SNS topic and SQS queue are in different AWS accounts but the same region it is important for the "aws_sns_topic_subscription" to use the AWS provider of the account with the SQS queue. If "aws_sns_topic_subscription" is using a Provider with a different account than the SQS queue, terraform creates the subscriptions but does not keep state and tries to re-create the subscription at every apply.

~> **NOTE:** If SNS topic and SQS queue are in different AWS accounts and different AWS regions it is important to recognize that the subscription needs to be initiated from the account with the SQS queue but in the region of the SNS topic.

			Description: `

Provides an EC2 Spot Instance Request resource. This allows instances to be
requested on the spot market.

By default Terraform creates Spot Instance Requests with a ` + "`" + `persistent` + "`" + ` type,
which means that for the duration of their lifetime, AWS will launch an
instance with the configured details if and when the spot market will accept
the requested price.

On destruction, Terraform will make an attempt to terminate the associated Spot
Instance if there is one present.

Spot Instances requests with a ` + "`" + `one-time` + "`" + ` type will close the spot request
when the instance is terminated either by the request being below the current spot
price availability or by a user.

~> **NOTE:** Because their behavior depends on the live status of the spot
market, Spot Instance Requests have a unique lifecycle that makes them behave
differently than other Terraform resources. Most importantly: there is __no
guarantee__ that a Spot Instance exists to fulfill the request at any given
point in time. See the [AWS Spot Instance
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html)
for more information.
