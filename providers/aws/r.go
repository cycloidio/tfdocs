			ShortDescription: `Requests and manages a certificate from Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM).`,
			Description: `

The ACM certificate resource allows requesting and management of certificates
from the Amazon Certificate Manager.

It deals with requesting certificates and managing their attributes and life-cycle.
This resource does not deal with validation of a certificate but can provide inputs
for other resources implementing the validation. It does not wait for a certificate to be issued.
Use a [` + "`" + `aws_acm_certificate_validation` + "`" + `](acm_certificate_validation.html) resource for this.

Most commonly, this resource is used together with [` + "`" + `aws_route53_record` + "`" + `](route53_record.html) and
[` + "`" + `aws_acm_certificate_validation` + "`" + `](acm_certificate_validation.html) to request a DNS validated certificate,
deploy the required validation records and wait for validation to complete.

Domain validation through email is also supported but should be avoided as it requires a manual step outside
of Terraform.

It's recommended to specify ` + "`" + `create_before_destroy = true` + "`" + ` in a [lifecycle][1] block to replace a certificate
which is currently in use (eg, by [` + "`" + `aws_lb_listener` + "`" + `](lb_listener.html)).

This resource is best applied to an instance that is stopped when this instance
is created, so that the contents of the created image are predictable. When
applied to an instance that is running, *the instance will be stopped before taking
the snapshots and then started back up again*, resulting in a period of
downtime.

Note that the source instance is inspected only at the initial creation of this
resource. Ongoing updates to the referenced instance will not be propagated into
the generated AMI. Users may taint or otherwise recreate the resource in order
to produce a fresh snapshot.

			ShortDescription: `Manages an API Gateway REST Deployment.`,
			Description: `

Manages an API Gateway REST Deployment. A deployment is a snapshot of the REST API configuration. The deployment can then be published to callable endpoints via the [` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_stage` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_stage.html) and optionally managed further with the [` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_base_path_mapping.html), [` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_domain_name` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_domain_name.html), and [` + "`" + `aws_api_method_settings` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_method_settings.html). For more information, see the [API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-deploy-api.html).

To properly capture all REST API configuration in a deployment, this resource must have dependencies on all prior Terraform resources that manage resources/paths, methods, integrations, etc.

* For REST APIs that are configured via OpenAPI specification ([` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_rest_api` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_rest_api.html) ` + "`" + `body` + "`" + ` argument), no special dependency setup is needed beyond referencing the  ` + "`" + `id` + "`" + ` attribute of that resource unless additional Terraform resources have further customized the REST API.
* When the REST API configuration involves other Terraform resources ([` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_integration` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_integration.html), etc.), the dependency setup can be done with implicit resource references in the ` + "`" + `triggers` + "`" + ` argument or explicit resource references using the [resource ` + "`" + `depends_on` + "`" + ` meta-argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/depends_on.html). The ` + "`" + `triggers` + "`" + ` argument should be preferred over ` + "`" + `depends_on` + "`" + `, since ` + "`" + `depends_on` + "`" + ` can only capture dependency ordering and will not cause the resource to recreate (redeploy the REST API) with upstream configuration changes.

!> **WARNING:** It is recommended to use the [` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_stage` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_stage.html) instead of managing an API Gateway Stage via the ` + "`" + `stage_name` + "`" + ` argument of this resource. When this resource is recreated (REST API redeployment) with the ` + "`" + `stage_name` + "`" + ` configured, the stage is deleted and recreated. This will cause a temporary service interruption, increase Terraform plan differences, and can require a second Terraform apply to recreate any downstream stage configuration such as associated ` + "`" + `aws_api_method_settings` + "`" + ` resources.

~> **NOTE:** It is recommended to enable the [resource ` + "`" + `lifecycle` + "`" + ` configuration block ` + "`" + `create_before_destroy` + "`" + ` argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#create_before_destroy) in this resource configuration to properly order redeployments in Terraform. Without enabling ` + "`" + `create_before_destroy` + "`" + `, API Gateway can return errors such as ` + "`" + `BadRequestException: Active stages pointing to this deployment must be moved or deleted` + "`" + ` on recreation.

			ShortDescription: `Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway.`,
			Description: `

Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway. Additional information about this functionality
can be found in the [API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html).

This resource just establishes ownership of and the TLS settings for
a particular domain name. An API can be attached to a particular path
under the registered domain name using
[the ` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` + "`" + ` resource](api_gateway_base_path_mapping.html).

API Gateway domains can be defined as either 'edge-optimized' or 'regional'.  In an edge-optimized configuration,
API Gateway internally creates and manages a CloudFront distribution to route requests on the given hostname. In
addition to this resource it's necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the given domain name which is an alias
(either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the Cloudfront domain name exported in the ` + "`" + `cloudfront_domain_name` + "`" + `
attribute.

In a regional configuration, API Gateway does not create a CloudFront distribution to route requests to the API, though
a distribution can be created if needed. In either case, it is necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the
given domain name which is an alias (either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the regional domain name exported in
the ` + "`" + `regional_domain_name` + "`" + ` attribute.

~> **Note:** API Gateway requires the use of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates instead of Identity and Access Management (IAM) certificates in regions that support ACM. Regions that support ACM can be found in the [Regions and Endpoints Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#acm_region). To import an existing private key and certificate into ACM or request an ACM certificate, see the [` + "`" + `aws_acm_certificate` + "`" + ` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/acm_certificate.html).

~> **Note:** The ` + "`" + `aws_api_gateway_domain_name` + "`" + ` resource expects dependency on the ` + "`" + `aws_acm_certificate_validation` + "`" + ` as
only verified certificates can be used. This can be made either explicitly by adding the
` + "`" + `depends_on = [aws_acm_certificate_validation.cert]` + "`" + ` attribute. Or implicitly by referring certificate ARN
from the validation resource where it will be available after the resource creation:
` + "`" + `regional_certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate_validation.cert.certificate_arn` + "`" + `.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the private key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.

			Description: `

Provides an RDS instance resource.  A DB instance is an isolated database
environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created
databases.

Changes to a DB instance can occur when you manually change a parameter, such as
` + "`" + `allocated_storage` + "`" + `, and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because
of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because a
modification has not yet taken place. You can use the ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` flag
to instruct the service to apply the change immediately (see documentation
below).

When upgrading the major version of an engine, ` + "`" + `allow_major_version_upgrade` + "`" + `
must be set to ` + "`" + `true` + "`" + `.

~> **Note:** using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a brief downtime as the
server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][2] for more information.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in
the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in

			ShortDescription: `Provides an AWS EIP Association`,
			Description: `

Provides an AWS EIP Association as a top level resource, to associate and
disassociate Elastic IPs from AWS Instances and Network Interfaces.

~> **NOTE:** Do not use this resource to associate an EIP to ` + "`" + `aws_lb` + "`" + ` or ` + "`" + `aws_nat_gateway` + "`" + ` resources. Instead use the ` + "`" + `allocation_id` + "`" + ` available in those resources to allow AWS to manage the association, otherwise you will see ` + "`" + `AuthFailure` + "`" + ` errors.

~> **NOTE:** ` + "`" + `aws_eip_association` + "`" + ` is useful in scenarios where EIPs are either
pre-existing or distributed to customers or users and therefore cannot be changed.

For working with Redis (Cluster Mode Enabled) replication groups, see the

~> **Note:** When you change an attribute, such as ` + "`" + `num_cache_nodes` + "`" + `, by default
it is applied in the next maintenance window. Because of this, Terraform may report
a difference in its planning phase because the actual modification has not yet taken
place. You can use the ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` flag to instruct the service to apply the
change immediately. Using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a brief downtime as the server reboots.

			Description: `

Provides an ElastiCache Replication Group resource.

For working with a [Memcached cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/WhatIs.html) or a
[single-node Redis instance (Cluster Mode Disabled)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/WhatIs.html),
see the [` + "`" + `aws_elasticache_cluster` + "`" + ` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/elasticache_cluster.html).

~> **Note:** When you change an attribute, such as ` + "`" + `engine_version` + "`" + `, by
default the ElastiCache API applies it in the next maintenance window. Because
of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because the
actual modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` flag to instruct the service to apply the change
immediately. Using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a brief downtime as
servers reboots.
See the AWS Documentation on
[Modifying an ElastiCache Cache Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Clusters.Modify.html)
for more information.

~> **Note:** Any attribute changes that re-create the resource will be applied immediately, regardless of the value of ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + `.

~> **Note:** Be aware of the terminology collision around "cluster" for ` + "`" + `aws_elasticache_replication_group` + "`" + `. For example, it is possible to create a ["Cluster Mode Disabled [Redis] Cluster"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Clusters.Create.CON.Redis.html). With "Cluster Mode Enabled", the data will be stored in shards (called "node groups"). See [Redis Cluster Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/cluster-create-determine-requirements.html#redis-cluster-configuration) for a diagram of the differences. To enable cluster mode, use a parameter group that has cluster mode enabled. The default parameter groups provided by AWS end with ".cluster.on", for example ` + "`" + `default.redis6.x.cluster.on` + "`" + `.

This ensures that no stripe crosses block boundaries and causes remote reads within a node-local task.

~> **NOTE:** Due to [AWS Lambda improved VPC networking changes that began deploying in September 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-improved-vpc-networking-for-aws-lambda-functions/), EC2 subnets and security groups associated with Lambda Functions can take up to 45 minutes to successfully delete. Terraform AWS Provider version 2.31.0 and later automatically handles this increased timeout, however prior versions require setting the customizable deletion timeouts of those Terraform resources to 45 minutes (` + "`" + `delete = "45m"` + "`" + `). AWS and HashiCorp are working together to reduce the amount of time required for resource deletion and updates can be tracked in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/10329).

-> To give an external source (like a CloudWatch Event Rule, SNS, or S3) permission to access the Lambda function, use the [` + "`" + `aws_lambda_permission` + "`" + `](lambda_permission.html) resource. See [Lambda Permission Model][4] for more details. On the other hand, the ` + "`" + `role` + "`" + ` argument of this resource is the function's execution role for identity and access to AWS services and resources.

-> For more information on Amazon MQ, see [Amazon MQ documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/welcome.html).

~> **NOTE:** Amazon MQ currently places limits on **RabbitMQ** brokers. For example, a RabbitMQ broker cannot have: instances with an associated IP address of an ENI attached to the broker, an associated LDAP server to authenticate and authorize broker connections, storage type ` + "`" + `EFS` + "`" + `, audit logging, or ` + "`" + `configuration` + "`" + ` blocks. Although this resource allows you to create RabbitMQ users, RabbitMQ users cannot have console access or groups. Also, Amazon MQ does not return information about RabbitMQ users so drift detection is not possible.

~> **NOTE:** Changes to an MQ Broker can occur when you change a parameter, such as ` + "`" + `configuration` + "`" + ` or ` + "`" + `user` + "`" + `, and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately (see documentation below). Using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a brief downtime as the broker reboots.

~> **NOTE:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

-> **Note:** The following assumes the MSK cluster has SASL/SCRAM authentication enabled. See below for example usage or refer to the [Username/Password Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-password.html) section of the MSK Developer Guide for more details.

To set up username and password authentication for a cluster, create an [` + "`" + `aws_secretsmanager_secret` + "`" + ` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/secretsmanager_secret.html) and associate
a username and password with the secret with an [` + "`" + `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version` + "`" + ` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/secretsmanager_secret_version.html). When creating a secret for the cluster,
the ` + "`" + `name` + "`" + ` must have the prefix ` + "`" + `AmazonMSK_` + "`" + ` and you must either use an existing custom AWS KMS key or create a new
custom AWS KMS key for your secret with the [` + "`" + `aws_kms_key` + "`" + ` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/kms_key.html). It is important to note that a policy is required for the ` + "`" + `aws_secretsmanager_secret` + "`" + `
resource in order for Kafka to be able to read it. This policy is attached automatically when the ` + "`" + `aws_msk_scram_secret_association` + "`" + ` is used,
however, this policy will not be in terraform and as such, will present a diff on plan/apply. For that reason, you must use the [` + "`" + `aws_secretsmanager_secret_policy` + "`" + `
resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/secretsmanager_secret_policy.html) as shown below in order to ensure that the state is in a clean state after the creation of secret and the association to the cluster.

see [Comparison between Aurora MySQL 1 and Aurora MySQL 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Updates.20180206.html)
in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

Changes to an RDS Cluster can occur when you manually change a
parameter, such as ` + "`" + `port` + "`" + `, and are reflected in the next maintenance
window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately
(see documentation below).

~> **Note:** using ` + "`" + `apply_immediately` + "`" + ` can result in a
brief downtime as the server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][4]
for more information.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.

Provides an RDS Cluster Instance Resource. A Cluster Instance Resource defines
attributes that are specific to a single instance in a [RDS Cluster][3],
specifically running Amazon Aurora.

Unlike other RDS resources that support replication, with Amazon Aurora you do
not designate a primary and subsequent replicas. Instead, you simply add RDS
Instances and Aurora manages the replication. You can use the [count][5]
meta-parameter to make multiple instances and join them all to the same RDS
Cluster, or you may specify different Cluster Instance resources with various
` + "`" + `instance_class` + "`" + ` sizes.

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see [Aurora on Amazon RDS][2] in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

~> **NOTE:** Deletion Protection from the RDS service can only be enabled at the cluster level, not for individual cluster instances. You can still add the [` + "`" + `prevent_destroy` + "`" + ` lifecycle behavior](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#prevent_destroy) to your Terraform resource configuration if you desire protection from accidental deletion.

~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently
provides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html) and a Route Table resource with routes
defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes
in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause
a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.

~> **NOTE on ` + "`" + `gateway_id` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `nat_gateway_id` + "`" + `:** The AWS API is very forgiving with these two
attributes and the ` + "`" + `aws_route_table` + "`" + ` resource can be created with a NAT ID specified as a Gateway ID attribute.
This _will_ lead to a permanent diff between your configuration and statefile, as the API returns the correct
parameters in the returned route table. If you're experiencing constant diffs in your ` + "`" + `aws_route_table` + "`" + ` resources,
the first thing to check is whether or not you're specifying a NAT ID instead of a Gateway ID, or vice-versa.

~> **NOTE on ` + "`" + `propagating_vgws` + "`" + ` and the ` + "`" + `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation` + "`" + ` resource:**
If the ` + "`" + `propagating_vgws` + "`" + ` argument is present, it's not supported to _also_

this resource will delete any propagating gateways not explicitly listed in

~> **NOTE:** Referencing Security Groups across VPC peering has certain restrictions. More information is available in the [VPC Peering User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-security-groups.html).

~> **NOTE:** Due to [AWS Lambda improved VPC networking changes that began deploying in September 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-improved-vpc-networking-for-aws-lambda-functions/), security groups associated with Lambda Functions can take up to 45 minutes to successfully delete. Terraform AWS Provider version 2.31.0 and later automatically handles this increased timeout, however prior versions require setting the [customizable deletion timeout](#timeouts) to 45 minutes (` + "`" + `delete = "45m"` + "`" + `). AWS and HashiCorp are working together to reduce the amount of time required for resource deletion and updates can be tracked in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/10329).

			Description: `

Provides a resource for subscribing to SNS topics. Requires that an SNS topic exist for the subscription to attach to. This resource allows you to automatically place messages sent to SNS topics in SQS queues, send them as HTTP(S) POST requests to a given endpoint, send SMS messages, or notify devices / applications. The most likely use case for Terraform users will probably be SQS queues.

~> **NOTE:** If the SNS topic and SQS queue are in different AWS regions, the ` + "`" + `aws_sns_topic_subscription` + "`" + ` must use an AWS provider that is in the same region as the SNS topic. If the ` + "`" + `aws_sns_topic_subscription` + "`" + ` uses a provider with a different region than the SNS topic, Terraform will fail to create the subscription.

~> **NOTE:** Setup of cross-account subscriptions from SNS topics to SQS queues requires Terraform to have access to BOTH accounts.

~> **NOTE:** If an SNS topic and SQS queue are in different AWS accounts but the same region, the ` + "`" + `aws_sns_topic_subscription` + "`" + ` must use the AWS provider for the account with the SQS queue. If ` + "`" + `aws_sns_topic_subscription` + "`" + ` uses a Provider with a different account than the SQS queue, Terraform creates the subscription but does not keep state and tries to re-create the subscription at every ` + "`" + `apply` + "`" + `.

~> **NOTE:** If an SNS topic and SQS queue are in different AWS accounts and different AWS regions, the subscription needs to be initiated from the account with the SQS queue but in the region of the SNS topic.

~> **NOTE:** You cannot unsubscribe to a subscription that is pending confirmation. If you use ` + "`" + `email` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `email-json` + "`" + `, or ` + "`" + `http` + "`" + `/` + "`" + `https` + "`" + ` (without auto-confirmation enabled), until the subscription is confirmed (e.g., outside of Terraform), AWS does not allow Terraform to delete / unsubscribe the subscription. If you ` + "`" + `destroy` + "`" + ` an unconfirmed subscription, Terraform will remove the subscription from its state but the subscription will still exist in AWS. However, if you delete an SNS topic, SNS [deletes all the subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-delete-subscription-topic.html) associated with the topic. Also, you can import a subscription after confirmation and then have the capability to delete it.

			ShortDescription: `Provides a Spot Instance Request resource.`,
			Description: `

Provides an EC2 Spot Instance Request resource. This allows instances to be
requested on the spot market.

By default Terraform creates Spot Instance Requests with a ` + "`" + `persistent` + "`" + ` type,
which means that for the duration of their lifetime, AWS will launch an
instance with the configured details if and when the spot market will accept
the requested price.

On destruction, Terraform will make an attempt to terminate the associated Spot
Instance if there is one present.

Spot Instances requests with a ` + "`" + `one-time` + "`" + ` type will close the spot request
when the instance is terminated either by the request being below the current spot
price availability or by a user.

~> **NOTE:** Because their behavior depends on the live status of the spot
market, Spot Instance Requests have a unique lifecycle that makes them behave
differently than other Terraform resources. Most importantly: there is __no
guarantee__ that a Spot Instance exists to fulfill the request at any given
point in time. See the [AWS Spot Instance
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html)
for more information.

~> **NOTE:** Due to [AWS Lambda improved VPC networking changes that began deploying in September 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-improved-vpc-networking-for-aws-lambda-functions/), subnets associated with Lambda Functions can take up to 45 minutes to successfully delete. Terraform AWS Provider version 2.31.0 and later automatically handles this increased timeout, however prior versions require setting the [customizable deletion timeout](#timeouts) to 45 minutes (` + "`" + `delete = "45m"` + "`" + `). AWS and HashiCorp are working together to reduce the amount of time required for resource deletion and updates can be tracked in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/10329).

Provides a resource to manage a VPC peering connection.

~> **NOTE on VPC Peering Connections and VPC Peering Connection Options:** Terraform provides
both a standalone [VPC Peering Connection Options](vpc_peering_connection_options.html) and a VPC Peering Connection
resource with ` + "`" + `accepter` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `requester` + "`" + ` attributes. Do not manage options for the same VPC peering
connection in both a VPC Peering Connection resource and a VPC Peering Connection Options resource.
Doing so will cause a conflict of options and will overwrite the options.
Using a VPC Peering Connection Options resource decouples management of the connection options from
management of the VPC Peering Connection and allows options to be set correctly in cross-account scenarios.

-> **Note:** For cross-account (requester's AWS account differs from the accepter's AWS account) or inter-region
VPC Peering Connections use the ` + "`" + `aws_vpc_peering_connection` + "`" + ` resource to manage the requester's side of the
connection and use the ` + "`" + `aws_vpc_peering_connection_accepter` + "`" + ` resource to manage the accepter's side of the connection.
